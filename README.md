A secure pure python password generator using Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG).
CSPRNG have passed statistical randomness tests as well as they hold relly well under attack.
This is an algorithm designed to produce a sequence of numbers that is both random and unpredictable.

**key characteristics**

**Unpredictable output:** A CSPRNG is designed so that an attacker cannot predict the next number in the sequence, even with knowledge of previous numbers.

**Secure against state compromise:** If an attacker learns the internal state of the CSPRNG, they should be unable to reconstruct any previous random numbers.

**Cryptographically secure:** The numbers produced are statistically indistinguishable from true random numbers and are suitable for use in encryption, digital signatures, and other security protocols.
